# library-app

This application is a mock website for a Library!

MVP:
  1. Users are able to search through a list of books or view all of the books
  2. Users are able to add / remove books from their shopping cart to be rented
  3. When a user rents a book, that book becomes shown as unavailable so other people can't rent it
  4. When a user is done with the book, they can "return" the book so it's available for others to rent
  5. Users can "donate" a book and add a new one to the libraries book list
